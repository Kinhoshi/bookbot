BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

[Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) guided project
BookBot is not only my first python project, it's my first project entirely.
Please bear with me as I have never before in my life written a readme!

BookBot is a simple python script that was created with guidance from https://boot.dev
it reads all the characters in a simple .txt document, e.g Frankenstein.txt by Mary Shelley and creates a simple report based on the contents of frankenstein.txt
it will then spit that report out in a simple txt file named "report.txt" in the books directory.

I'm assuming that this project won't function very well if you don't have a subdirectory named "books" and the aformentioned frankenstein.txt within the books subdirectory.

Currently, I'm satisfied that this project works, but not satisfied with how clunky it appears, I may or may not edit it to look nicer and work better, as my skills get better.

If you at all wasted your time with this small script, or even if you took the time to read this to the end, I want to thank you for choosing to spend your time on my project and the contents within!

Changelog:
Revised the read_book function with a simple try/except block that will create a simple error.log if the file is not found.
Added new function to write the report to a txt file, instead of creating that report in other functions. Will revise further, at a later date.
