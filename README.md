# bookbot

[Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) guided project
BookBot is not only my first python project, it's my first project entirely.
Please bear with me as I have never before in my life written a readme!

BookBot is a simple python script that was created with guidance from https://boot.dev.
It reads all the characters in a simple .txt document, e.g Frankenstein.txt by Mary Shelley and creates a simple report based on the contents of the txt document you feed it.
it will then spit that report out in a simple txt file named "report.txt" in the books directory.

I think I'm pretty satisfied with this script and will only revisit this if the course receives further updates or I get better at making scripts.

If you at all wasted your time with this small script, or even if you took the time to read this to the end, I want to thank you for choosing to spend your time on my project and the contents within!

Changelog:
Completely re-written the script using the updated course on https://boot.dev and a hopefully little bit of better knowledge of python.
Revised the read_book function with a simple try/except block that will create a simple error.log if the file is not found.
Added new function to write the report to a txt file, instead of creating that report in other functions. Will revise further, at a later date.
